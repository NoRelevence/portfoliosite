		<article>
			<section>
			<p>"Hello world" My name is Carter Mooney, I am 19 years old and a graphic design student at <br>
				Niagara College. I am in my second year and am really just having a great time, this is essentially<br> everything that I have always thought school should be like. I am planning on going into the field <br>
				potentially specializing in web design, and photography. I have learned so much from all of my <br>
				professors in the past few school years. My drawing ability has gone up a lot, and my knowledge of<br>
				programs such as Photoshop and Illustrator have also increased. I love what I do and the challenges<br>
				the professors give us. Even this website is nothing more than a project for Web Design one. Basically, 
				<br>I am just excited to see where this could take me.</p>
