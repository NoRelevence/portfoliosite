		<h1>Graphic Design</h1>
		<article>
			<section>
			<p> When you think about graphic design, logos, art and companies come to mind. <br> These are but just the beginnings of what being a graphic designer means.<br>
			As we have been told again and again by professors, any idiot can pirate photoshop<br> and illustrator, and call themselves a graphic designer, but that isn't<br>
			what its all about. Its not the programs you use, its not the attention to details,<br> its not the talent. Its all about the process, being given a project you hate with a <br>
			passion and turning it into your crowning acheivement. Its the prep time, the peer <br>critiques, the late nights fueled by coffee and energy drinks trying to get that last bit<br>
			done. Think on that last sentance for a minute. Doesn't that sound a little bit like<br> school? Thats because the graphic designers job isnt just to create something<br> 
			someone else can be proud of, its about learning new things to make people happy, to <br>give them a glow that only that perfect logo or design, or drawing can. <br>
			Its all about learning, even our professors have admitted to learning meriads or new<br> and unique things from students. Things that they will use to create other things<br>
			things that make them happy. Graphic design isnt just a program you use, or a career<br> path, It's a unique perspective on life, something that makes you notice everything <br>
			and learn anything from anyone. its... Fun.</p>
