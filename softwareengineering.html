			<h1>Software Engineering</h1>
			<p>My starting point, I found my first passion in creating games and coding since grade 9 
				I learned how to from one of my favourite teachers ever, Mr. King from CWDHS. He was 
				a very unconventional teacher, he gave it the "fuck it appraoch" allowing us complete
				freedom of information, and allowing us to work on whatever we wanted (within certain
				perameters) We have created may games, and it gave us the idea of what it was like to
				work in that kind of environment, essentially an indie game design firm. In my grade 9
				year I created a fully fuctional text based, choose your own adventure game. It was 600
				lines of code all created in Java Script. It was exhilarating to see it finally work properly.
				The entire process from concept, to design, to implementation, to finalizing it was viseral.
				It is probably the basis to my love for web design now. The functionality, the designing.
				In my grade 12 year we created a VR game from scratch, I assisted in some of the visual elements
				and in the proof reading, I allowed my coding so slip from me, and lost it until web design this year.</p>
